Classification of BBC news articles project for DTSA 5510 Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning

In this project we compare two approaches for this type of classification task.

The first approach is a supervised learning method that uses word2vec with mean pooling to create document embeddings, followed by KNN.

The second is an unsupervised approach that uses TF-IDF, that is followed by NMF (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization).
